#Who is Sarr Loum
This man is one of the **best programmers** who ever walked on the face of this earth.
He is a self-thought and a very **_impressive human_**. His ability to pick up a subject and process it very quickly is out of this world. This man is too good for this programming stuff.
His plan is to conquer the world by bringing into real life all the worlds in his imagination through the power of programming.
and his biggest dream or fantasy is to go out to space. 
He said: 
>that one day he'll step on the moon.
