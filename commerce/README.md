![Network Preview](network-preview.jpg)

**Description:**

Network is a full-stack web application that replicates the functionality and user interface of Twitter.

This project provides a Twitter-like experience with a similar user interface and key features.

**Features:**

- **User Registration and Authentication:** Users can create accounts, log in, and maintain secure access to the application.

- **Posting, Reposting, and Quoting Tweets:** Users can create new tweets, repost tweets from others, and quote tweets, just like on Twitter.

- **Real-time Updates:** The application provides real-time updates of user activities, including new tweets and interactions.

- **User Profiles:** Users have profiles that display their tweets, followers, and following.

- **Follow/Followers Functionality:** Users can follow and be followed by other users, creating a social network aspect similar to Twitter.
